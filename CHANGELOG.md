## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Backend skeleton: configuration from `STATOR_*` variables, a Postgres
  cluster with tenant-scoped transactions and row level security, the
  foundation migration, and an HTTP API with `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`
  and an OpenAPI document generated from its route table.
- Custom themes in the `armature-theme/1` format, so Armature theme files
  import unchanged: colours, fonts, shape, shadows, cursors, icons, backdrop,
  a moving effect and extra CSS, with Armature's limits. Themes are a
  person's, shared with the organization when they say so; an organization
  may name a shared theme as its default. Deep-Tech and Constellation ship
  as examples, and a theme editor previews a draft live on the page.
- File storage in any S3 compatible bucket, configured with `STATOR_S3_*`.
