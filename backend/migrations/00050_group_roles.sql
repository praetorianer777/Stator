-- role, and, per membership, whether its role came from the provider or from
-- somebody here.

-- 'manual' is a role somebody here chose, or the member every membership
-- falls back to; the provider leaves it alone unless a mapped group applies.
-- 'oidc' is a role the provider's groups gave, which the next sign-in may
-- take back.

-- forgets fail rather than lock the organization out.
